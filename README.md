## A Replit customized Rails vanilla app

This is a Rails Demo app made for testing and exhibition. Forked from a Replit rails template. 


## Running the app

Simple hit run!  

_You can edit the run command from the `.replit` file._

## Running commands

Start every command with `bundle exec` so that it runs in the context of the installed gems environment. The console pane will give you output from the server but you can run arbitrary command from the shell without stopping the server.

## Database

SQLite would work in development but we don't recommend running it in production. Instead look into using the built-in [Replit database](http://docs.replit.com/misc/database). Otherwise you are welcome to connect databases from your favorite provider. 

## Help

If you need help you might be able to find an answer on our [docs](https://docs.replit.com) page. Alternatively you can [ask in the community](https://replit.com/talk/ask). Feel free to report bugs [here](https://replit.com/bugs) and give us feedback [here](https://Replit/feedback).
